# -Alternative-Language-Project-In-CSharp-
## -Which programming language and version did you pick?-
I chose C# (C Sharp) with the .NET 7.0 framework for this project.
## -Why did you pick this programming language?-
 I initially picked it because I believed it would be the closest to languages I already know, that being C, C++, and others. So I would be able to smoothly transition into C#. However after learning more and more about C# I was able to solidify my decision into picking C#. 
## -List out 3 libraries you used from your programming language (if applicable) and explain what they are, why you chose them and what you used them for.-
 1.) System.IO: This namespace is used for all file handling operations, including reading from and writing to files. I used it cause it was needed for ingesting the .CSV data for processing.
 2.) System.Linq: This one gives a set of methods for querying objects. I used it cause i was convenient for operating data collections more conveniently and expressively.
 3.) System.Text.RegularExpressions: This other namespace was used to parse CSV data correctly, usually for handling complex patterns like quotes inside quoted strings.
